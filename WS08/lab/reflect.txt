Before completing this workshop, I spent 2 hours reviewing the lecture and testing myself on my knowledge. Next, because I was still quite weak in the C++ language, I spent a lot of time writing code for classes such as Line, Shape and LblShape, to debugging and correcting small errors. Each step helped me better understand inheritance and polymorphism in programming.

Through this, I feel like I've learned a little more about how to work with virtual classes and functions, as well as how to manage memory more effectively. I also learned that paying attention to small details like properly formatting output can have a big impact on the quality of the final product.

Overall, this exercise was quite interesting and useful, helping me connect the theory I learned with actual coding. I hope I will be able to apply what I have learned to future assignments.
